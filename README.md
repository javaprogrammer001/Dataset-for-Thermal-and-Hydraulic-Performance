# Dataset-for-Thermal-and-Hydraulic-Performance
This repository contains experimental data from a study on the thermal and hydraulic performance of stainless-steel pillow plate heat exchangers (PPHEs) under natural (ambient-air) cooling. The dataset was generated by circulating hot water through the PPHE inner channels while cooling occurs by free convection to ambient air.
