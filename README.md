# Dataset-for-Thermal-and-Hydraulic-Performance
This repository contains experimental data from a study on the thermal and hydraulic performance of stainless-steel pillow plate heat exchangers (PPHEs) under natural (ambient-air) cooling. The dataset was generated by circulating hot water through the PPHE inner channels while cooling occurs by free convection to ambient air.

# Key Features of the Dataset:

# Experiment Parameters:

- Bulk water temperatures: 50°C and 60°C
- Plate spacing: 50 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm
- Number of active plates: 1, 2, 3
- Flow rates: 5–30 LPM depending on the number of active plates

# Measurements:

- Temperature readings from 16 T-type thermocouples at critical locations (tank, ambient, plate inlets/outlets, plate surfaces)
- Pressure drop across the heat exchanger
- Flow rate through the plates

# Dataset Structure:

- Each row corresponds to a single test condition with multiple readings averaged under steady-state conditions
- Columns include flow rate, active plates, thermocouple temperatures, inlet/outlet pressures, and calculated pressure drop

# Applications:

- Validation of numerical models
- Development of empirical heat transfer correlations for PPHEs
- Analysis of natural convection performance for compact heat exchangers

# Additional Resources:

- Images of the experimental setup are included for reference.
- Thermocouple positions and channel mappings are detailed to aid interpretation of the data.

# Dataset Size:

- 90 variations: 15 flow rate conditions × 3 plate spacing × 2 bulk temperatures
- Multiple readings per variation (averaged for analysis)
